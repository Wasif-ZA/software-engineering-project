# I2SSE Contest

This is the repository for the I2SSE contest. Use this README to descrbe the basics of you project.


## Topic
The 3 words drawn by FTM2 were, Farmer, Floating, Panda. We proposed a few ideas as to what the objective of our program would be.
We settled on designing a game where a "Farmer" rescues a "Floating" "Panda", Where the objective is to swim and get a hold of a panda that fell into the lake.

## User Manual or Instructions


-Game Objective

In the game “Rogue Panda” the main objective for the user is to prevent the floating Panda from hitting the wall 10 times. If the Panda manages to hit the wall 10 times, the game ends and the user will be required to start over.

-Controls

Right arrow key: The farmer moves right.
Up arrow key: The farmer moves up.
Down arrow key: The farmer moves down.
Left arrow key: The farmer moves left.

-How to play

When the user starts the game. The Panda spawns and will immediately start moving around.

Use the arrow keys to move around and find the hidden switch that activates the cage and stops the Rogue Panda from escaping.

Your goal is to stop activate the cage before the panda hits the walls 10 times. Once the game launches the user will be able to move around and look for the hidden button. Keep a close eye on the Panda. If the user sees the Panda approaching the wall, they can move the farmer with the arrow keys and push the panda away.

Counter: There will be a counter on the top left hand side of the screen. Every time the Panda hits the wall the counter will be increment by 1. Once the counter reaches 10 the game will end and the panda is free.
